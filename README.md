# Ahoi Kapptn! Challenge

This repository contains a Next.js app created as part of a coding challenge for the company "Ahoi Kapptn!"

### The app uses modern web development approaches:

- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework) for rapid and consistent styling
- **TypeScript** for type-safe usage of JavaScript
- **React Context & React Provider** for managing and sharing state across components


### Improvements for the future:

- **Normalize Product Interface** for handling future product groups with different structures.
- Consider using a **ProductModelClass** to centralize and handle repeated nullish checks for properties like `price`, `img`, or `allergens`.
- Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA labels to interactive elements and icon-only buttons.
